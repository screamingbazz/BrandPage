Caching in REST APIs is about storing responses so the client (or an intermediate proxy/CDN) can reuse them instead of making the same request again.
1. Check HTTP Response Headers
The easiest way to know if caching is enabled is by inspecting response headers.
Look for these headers:
✅ Cache-Control
Most important header.
Examples:
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
➡ Means response is cached for 1 hour
Cache-Control: no-cache
➡ Must revalidate before reuse
Cache-Control: no-store
➡ No caching at all
In REST APIs, an ETag (Entity Tag) is a response header used for cache validation and optimistic concurrency control.
It tells the client:
“This is the specific version of the resource you just received.”
🔹 What is an ETag?
An ETag is a unique identifier generated by the server for a specific version of a resource.
Example response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "abc123"
That "abc123" represents the current version of the resource.
1️⃣ ETag for Caching (Performance)
ETags help avoid sending unchanged data again.
🔁 How it works:
Client requests a resource:
GET /users/1
Server responds:
200 OK
ETag: "abc123"
Later, client asks:
GET /users/1
If-None-Match: "abc123"
Server checks:
If unchanged →
304 Not Modified
(No body sent — saves bandwidth)
If changed →
200 OK
ETag: "new456"
(New data sent)

2️⃣ ETag for Concurrency Control (Prevent Overwrites)
ETags help prevent the lost update problem when multiple users edit the same resource.
Example:
Client fetches resource → gets:
ETag: "abc123"
Client updates using:
PUT /users/1
If-Match: "abc123"
Server checks:
If tag matches → update allowed
If tag doesn't match →
412 Precondition Failed

1️⃣ Cache-Control → Controls How Long to Cache

This header tells the client or proxy:

“Can you cache this response? And for how long?”
2️⃣ ETag → Detects If Resource Changed (Smart Validation)
Example:
ETag: "abc123"
When client requests again:
If-None-Match: "abc123"
If unchanged → server responds:
304 Not Modified
200 OK (if changed)
No body sent → saves bandwidth.
Last-Modified → Timestamp-Based Validation
Example:
Last-Modified: Wed, 26 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT
Client sends:
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 26 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT
If not changed → server returns:
304 Not Modified
200 OK (if changed)

✅ Purpose: Date-based validation

✅ Step 1: Send First Request

Example:

GET https://api.example.com/products

Response headers:

ETag: "abc123"
Last-Modified: Wed, 26 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=600
✅ Step 2: Save Headers in Postman

Go to Tests tab of the request and add:

// Save ETag
let etag = pm.response.headers.get("ETag");
pm.environment.set("etag_value", etag);

// Save Last-Modified
let lastModified = pm.response.headers.get("Last-Modified");
pm.environment.set("last_modified_value", lastModified);

Click Send
Now Postman stores:
{etag_value}}
{{last_modified_value}}
in your environment.
✅ Step 3: Use in Next Request
In the next request → go to Headers tab and add:
Key	Value
If-None-Match	{{etag_value}}
If-Modified-Since	{{last_modified_value}}
Now when you send the request:
If resource unchanged → you get 304 Not Modified
If changed → you get 200 OK with new body
🔥 Optional: Automatically Add Headers (Advanced)
Instead of manually adding headers, use Pre-request Script:
let etag = pm.environment.get("etag_value");
if (etag) {
    pm.request.headers.add({
        key: "If-None-Match",
        value: etag
    });
}

1️⃣ What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to a client (browser or app) to remember something about the client between requests.
Sent in HTTP headers.
Stored on client side (browser, Postman, mobile app).
Can be used for:
Sessions (login)
Preferences (language, theme)
Tracking (analytics)
🔹 2️⃣ How Cookies Work (Step by Step)
Step 1: Server Sets Cookie
Server response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure
sessionId=abcd1234 → value of the cookie
Path=/ → cookie valid for all URLs on this domain
HttpOnly → cannot be accessed by JavaScript (security)
Secure → sent only over HTTPS
Step 2: Client Stores Cookie
Browser or client stores this cookie.
The client automatically sends it in subsequent requests to the same domain/path.
Step 3: Client Sends Cookie Back
GET /profile
Host: example.com
Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234
Server reads sessionId and identifies the user.
Server responds with user-specific data.
3️⃣ What Data Does a Cookie Contain?
A cookie is just key-value data. It can also have metadata:
Field	                Purpose
Name=Value	          Actual data stored (e.g., sessionId, token)
Domain	              The domain that can receive the cookie
Path	URL              path that can receive the cookie
Expires / Max-Age      Lifetime of the cookie
Secure	              Send only over HTTPS
HttpOnly	             Cannot be read by JS (security)
SameSite	             Restrict cross-site sending (CSRF protection)
Automatically From Server Response
Send a login request that returns Set-Cookie.
Example response header:
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure
Postman automatically stores this cookie.
All subsequent requests to the same domain/path automatically include the cookie.
🔹 4️⃣ How Cookies Are Sent in Requests
Example header Postman sends:
GET /profile
Host: example.com
Cookie: sessionId=abcd1234
If multiple cookies are valid for that domain/path, Postman sends all of them in the Cookie header.
What is x-www-form-urlencoded?

It’s a way to send data in an HTTP request body.

Data is sent as key-value pairs, joined by &, like a URL query:

username=user1&password=mypassword

Spaces and special characters are encoded, e.g., a space → + or %20.

Header is automatically set as:

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

This tells the server: “Hey, the body is URL-encoded key-value data.”
🔹 2️⃣ When to Use It
Usually in POST requests, like login forms:

POST /login

Body contains username/password
Not for GET requests — GET usually uses query parameters in the URL.

🔹 3️⃣ Step-by-Step in Postman
Step 1: Create a POST Request
Open Postman → click + to create a new request
Set method to POST
Enter the URL, e.g., https://example.com/login
Step 2: Set Body Type
Click Body tab
Select x-www-form-urlencoded
Step 3: Add Key-Value Pairs
Add each piece of data you want to send:
Key	Value
username	user1
password	mypassword
Postman will encode it automatically when sending.
Step 4: Send Request
Click Send
Postman will send something like this:
Request headers (automatically added):
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Request body (sent to server):
username=user1&password=mypassword
Server reads this data and responds (for login, usually returns token or cookie).
🔹 4️⃣ How to Know What Postman Sent
After clicking Send, go to Postman → Console (View → Show Postman Console)
Youll see:
POST https://example.com/login
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
username=user1&password=mypassword
You can see exactly what Postman sent.
🔹 5️⃣ How to Use the Response
If the server returns a cookie, Postman stores it automatically for future requests.
If the server returns a token, you can copy it and use it in Authorization → Bearer Token or headers for subsequent requests.
2️⃣ Complete Example in REST-assured
import io.restassured.RestAssured;
import io.restassured.response.Response;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;
public class ApiResponseDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Response response = RestAssured
                .given()
                .get("https://api.example.com/users/123");
        // Status
        System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.getStatusCode());
        System.out.println("Status Line: " + response.getStatusLine());
        // Headers
        response.getHeaders().forEach(h -> 
            System.out.println(h.getName() + " : " + h.getValue())
        );
        // Body
        String responseBody = response.getBody().asString();
        System.out.println("Response Body: " + responseBody);
        // Access JSON field
        String name = response.jsonPath().getString("name");
        System.out.println("User Name: " + name);
    }
}
